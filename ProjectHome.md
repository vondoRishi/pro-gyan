Application of machine learning techniques to decipher biology is not new. It has been extensively used to solve protein classification problems. First, objects (sequence data) are converted into quantitative features that are understandable by the machine, which faces limitation of suitable feature calculation methods. Then useful features are selected to build a model and are shared with the community as a prediction tool or web server. These processes require extensive programming skills and the model building lies in the hands of the developers. _**It seems machines are continuously being programmed rather than learning**_. The available predictors can only classify proteins and unable to build new models from protein sequences for different classification problem. <br>

We have developed an automated application, <b>Pro-Gyan</b> to build protein classifiers. It automatically generates a large number of features, both conventional and novel, which encapsulates different physico-chemical properties of amino acids as well as their pattern. By efficiently filtering out noisy features using statistical methods, Pro-Gyan generates a model that can be evaluated with a test set. Further, these sets of models can be stored and shared. With aid of this tool experimental biologist can develop models from their own data. <b>Download</b> latest Pro-Gyan (Pro-Gyan-<code>&lt;</code>version>.zip ) and protein classifiers from <a href='https://sourceforge.net/projects/progyan/files/'>here</a>.<br>
